Product filter and add to cart from mysql database

This program is designed to open a interactive web page that displays a localized database(/includes/database.php) that
contains prodcut items from a list (products.php). The user can use various filters to display data either by name, price, or calories
and in either ascending or descending order. The user can then select various items that can be added to a shopping
cart(myCart.php) where the user can access or update.
